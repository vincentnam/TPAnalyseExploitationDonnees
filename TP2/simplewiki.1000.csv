The youngest child in a family of six, Naava Nabagesera was born to a middle-class Kiganda family. The fact that her mother is the daughter of the late Kabaka (king) Daudi Chwa (father of Kabaka Mutesa II) of the Buganda kingdom means that Nabagesera is of royal descent. However, since the Buganda monarchy was abolished in 1966, this aspect of her lineage carried very little significance in Nabagesera's formative years. Despite the fact that her mother was raised in the palace, she does not hold any diplomas or degree certificates. However, she has established herself as a very astute businesswoman. Nabagesera's father, who passed away in 1988, was an administrator and worked in the civil service as a district education officer.

In primary and secondary school Nabagesera held a series of responsible positions, such as prefect, school timekeeper, and head of the debating society. During her first year of law school at twenty years of age, she was married and in the same year bore a set of twins, which earned her the honorific title Nnalongo. Having a family to raise made it hard for Nabagesera to join campus politics, let alone pursue her law degree, and it took a lot of determination and hard work for her to complete the course. She attributes her resolute spirit to her mother:

My mother has been a major influence in my life. She's a very vociferous woman who takes on challenges. She takes on any kind of job that can earn her a living and does not lie back and say, ""I'm a lady."" I've never known my mother to stay at home. She told me that if you want to go for something do it the best way you can; if you really have the conviction that you can do something, just go all the way. She's a very active woman and has headed many organizations such as YWCA - she's one of the pioneers of that organization.

After obtaining her law degree and completing the bar course, Nabagesera was employed as a legal associate in a small law firm in Kampala and worked there for a year. She spent 1993 doing voluntary work as a legal adviser in a local nongovernmental organization called the Association of Women Lawyers (Federacion Internacional de Abogades, FIDA). Her work in the FIDA legal aid clinic exposed her to the realities of gender oppression and subordination suffered by Ugandan women, especially the indigent. The following year Nabagesera set up her own chambers, thus adding to the handful of female-owned law firms in Kampala.

6,Allan Kardec,"[[File:Alan Kardec 1.jpg|thumb|Alan Kardec 1]]
'''Allan Kardec'''  ('''Hippolyte Léon Denizard Rivail''' 3 October 1804 {{ndash}} 31 March 1869) was a [[French people|French]] [[philosopher]] and [[teacher]]. He dedicated the last 15 years of his life to organise a philosophical doctrine called [[Spiritism]]. He spread the educational ideas  of Pestalozzi in the 19th century. He published books on [[grammar]], [[mathematics]] and suggestions for the improvement of public education in [[France]]. He was a teacher of [[physiology]], [[astronomy]], [[physics]] and [[chemistry]]. The classes were at his home in [[Paris]].

In 1854, Kardec started studying phenomena which some people call ""paranormal"" or ""[[supernatural]]"". This were quite common at that time.

In his philosophy the spiritual manifestations were useful to the social and moral improvement of men.

[[Uranium mining]] and export and nuclear issues have often been the subject of public debate, and the [[anti-nuclear movement]] in Australia has a long history. It began with the 1972–73 debate over French nuclear testing in the Pacific, which involved several groups, and the 1976–77 debate about uranium mining in Australia.<ref>[http://www.greenleft.org.au/1998/330/20531 Australia's anti-nuclear movement: a short history] ''Green Left Online'', 26 August 1998. Retrieved [[12 January]] [[2008]].</ref> 

==Issues==

[[Image:Aerial view of the Ranger 3 site at Kakadu's Ranger Uranium Mine.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Aerial view of the Ranger 3 site located within Kakadu National Park]]
The case against nuclear power and uranium mining in Australia has been concerned with the impacts of nuclear energy; with the shortcomings of nuclear power as an energy source; and with presenting a [[sustainable energy]] strategy. The most prominent adverse impact of nuclear power is seen to be its potential contribution towards proliferation of [[nuclear weapons]]. For example, the 1976 Ranger Inquiry report stated that ""The nuclear power industry is unintentionally contributing to an increased risk of nuclear war. This is the most serious hazard associated with the industry"". 

The health risks associated with nuclear materials have also been of concern. This has been the case worldwide because of incidents like the [[Chernobyl disaster]], but Australian concerns have also involved specific local factors such as controversy over the health effects of nuclear testing in Australia and the South Pacific, and the emergence of prominent anti-nuclear campaigner [[Helen Caldicott]], who is a medical practitioner. 

The economics of nuclear power has been a factor in anti-nuclear campaigns, with critics arguing that such power is uneconomical in Australia,<ref>See, eg, Brian Martin, [http://www.uow.edu.au/arts/sts/bmartin/pubs/82search.pdf Nuclear Power and the Western Australia Electricity Grid], ''Search'', Vol. 13, No. 5–6, 1982. Retrieved 15 December 2008.</ref> particularly given the country's abundance of coal resources.

From the perspective of the anti-nuclear movement, most of the problems with nuclear power today are much the same as in the 1970s. Nuclear reactor accidents remain a possibility and no convincing solution to the problem of long-lived radioactive waste has been proposed. Nuclear weapons proliferation continues to occur. The alternatives to nuclear power, [[energy efficiency]] and [[renewable energy]] (especially [[wind power]]), have been further [[Renewable energy commercialization|developed and commercialised]].

I've become increasingly active here, so much so that editing has become somewhat difficult without the admin tools I'm used to on the English Wikipedia. I've done quite a bit of QD tagging recently, and I've created numerous articles. I also regularly contribute to RfA, PGA, and PVGA. I only have about <s>600</s> 750 edits, although I do have three months of experience here, as well as years of experience at other wikis. I don't view adminship as an award; the tools would be very helpful, however. Thank you for your consideration.

====Oppose====
:<s>'''Weak oppose''' 600 edits in roughly 5-7 months on here isn't a whole lot of edits.  I would have expected more edits (at least 1,000 total) before this request for adminship.  While you do do good work and while you are an administrator over on the English Wikipedia, I do not fully trust you yet.  I have not seen many edits from you recently (would expect a bit more activity).  I am not holding your activity level against you, though.  The main reason why I weakly oppose your RfA at this time is because you are not very visible on this project and because you have very few pages tagged for quick deletion.  Speaking of deletion, I only count 2 votes for pages on the RfD page, which is very minimal. I would expect to see more activity in the Wikipedia:RFD space because that is a good part of an administrators' job. Both of these things combined equals not very much use for the deletion tool at the moment. Your vandalism fighting is very good, however, again, I am not seeing very many warnings given to users of the changes that you revert. If you don't know how the warning system works, how can I expect you to know when a block is needed? You are very civil and mature, which are good things. All in all, you are a great user, but I cannot support you at this time based upon the things that I have brought up.

#{{oppose}} - edit counter shows only 205 edits ([http://toolserver.org/~vvv/yaec.php?user=Juliancolton&wiki=simplewiki_p]), and whilst that's obviously wrong, you do only have about 440 edits. I won't take into account that you are an admin at ENWP, since it has so often been argued to the point of just beating the quivering giblets that used to be a dead horse into the floor, that we are not ENWP and have different policies. Many a user has failed albeit being admin/crat on ENWP. I can count about 7 or 8 deleted edits, which are not quite enough and you've made ''one'' edit to WP:VIP.

#:I believe there are quite a few good reasons for the tools, actually.

====Comments====
*I don't quite understand this. He's clearly committed to the project, done excellent work, not the type to abuse the tools. Not one of the opposers have explained why he might abuse the tools, and not one has given an example of incorrect admin work. He's an enWiki admin with a lot of experience and accuracy. I ask you to look beyond the fact that his edit count is slightly lower than the rest. He would use the tools for maintenance and for the good of the project.

*I'm not a Simple English regular, so I don't feel comfortable voting (or !voting, if you're really sensitive about that ""voting""). Julian has been a regular contributor at that really big English Wikipedia for ages now, with ~75 Featured/Good articles, better than pretty much anyone I know. In addition to that, Julian has been one of the most active and helpful administrators over the past few months at least at the English Wikipedia. Why not just let him have the tools. He won't end up blocking...[[User:Jimbo Wales|this dude]] or deleting [[Main Page|this page]] or anything like that. Even if he uses his tools infrequently here, so what? Does anyone doubt that he will use his tools for the good of the project and are they willing to explain to me why?

*:I can see loads of people are supporting him because he's an EN.admin... He hasn't even been active for 3 months in a row. He does not contribute actively here and I can't say he'll be an active admin here in the future anyway because of his duty at en.wiki. It just looks like he's collecting flags. We would have been bettter of with someone '''more active and dedicated here'''. All english wikipedia admins editingn here with more or less 700 edits could request the flag. And '''you''''d all vote for them because they are good somewhere else. You have to face the facts, editors with 650 edits and 5 to months on and off editing don't need the flag here, they are simply not active enough to be of any use at all. If they spend 2 or three months extra (on top of their 6 months, not so active), editing they might be of more use as they'd show us they are active. But at the moment they're pointless. What tells you they won't just get the flag and leave simple completly? We need to be sure they are active and needed here. It's quite clear, Juliancolton is not. He may be a great editor/admin/article writer on EN, there is no point  having him delete 2 pages a week with the tools. <font face=""Comic sans ms""><b>[[user:Yotcmdr|<font color=""#000080"">Yot<font color=""#CD0000"">cmdr</font>]]</font> <sup><font face=""Times new roman""></b>[[user_talk:Yotcmdr|<font color=""turquoise"">=talk to the commander=</font>]]</small></sup></font> 09:07, 24 January 2009 (UTC)
*::A couple of points. First, have you looked at my contributions? I've been highly active for a while, having collected 500 edits since late November. I created an account in July, and although I didn't start editing right away, I've been contributing here since October. October to January is more than three months. Also, if you check my deleted contributions, I've probably done at least a dozen CSD tags in the last few  days, so what makes you think I'll delete two articles per week? Second, while I am an en.wp admin, and I do believe that demonstrates experience, that's not why I'm running for adminship here. I honestly don't understand where you came under the assumption that I'm simply collecting flags. I'm simply trying to help. Third, I do have a life, and I have other wikis to edit, so I'm not able to spend every moment of my time editing here. Finally, I'm sure I won't leave completely if/when I receive the tools.

14,Jerzy Popiełuszko,"{{Orphan|date=December 2010}}
[[File:Jerzy Popieluszko.jpg|right|250px|thumb|The blessed Jerzy Popieluszko]]
'''Jerzy Popiełuszko''' (pron. jɛʐɨ popʲɛwuʂko) ([[Okopy]], [[September 14|14th of September]] [[1947]] - [[Włocławek]], [[October 19|19th of October]] [[1984]]) was a Polish [[presbyter]], killed by officers of the ministry of the interior of the [[People's Republic of Poland]]. He is treated with great respect and honored as [[blessed]] by the [[Catholic Church]].

== Life ==
Born in Okopy a alone village near Suchowola, his parents were farmers, in this simple environment became grown to his [[vocation]].
He was ordered priest the [[May 28|28th of May]] [[1972]] in [[Warsaw]] by [[Cardinal]] [[Stefan Wyszyński]].

Until the 1980 he was priest in his home village, occupying himself mainly of the education of children and boys, since that moment began to near the movement of Polish workers and to subjects of social justice.

In his pastoral activity he took his work near the workers of [[steelworks]], celebrating a solemn mass in the factory during a strike of the [[metallurgy|metallurgiacal]] workers.

Next he joined the workers of the independent trade union Solidarność ([[Solidarity]]), adverse to the [[communism|communist]] system of government. He was a [[anticommunism|anticommunist]] sure of his faith, and in his [[preaching]]s launched criticisms to the system and invited the people to contest the system of government.

== The challenge to the system of government ==
During the period of the [[martial law]] ([[1981]] - [[1983]]) the [[Catholic Church]] was the  only force that could have a certain possibility of criticism, through the preachings during the celebration of the masses.

The [[homily|homilies]] and the preachings of father Popiełuszko were regularly transmitted by [[Radio Free Europe]], that gave him a certain popularity also in another countries.

He was initially threatened and invited to the silence by the Polish ministry of the interior, and the [[October 13|13th of October]] [[1984]] he was involved in a traffic accident from which however he went out whole.

== Murder ==
[[File:Jerzy Popieluszko Funeral - 49a.jpg|thumb|right|Image of the funeral]]
The [[October 19|19th of October]] [[1984]], of return from a pastoral service, was took away illegally and killed by three officers of the Ministry of the Interior, and his body was found the [[October 30|30th of October]] in the waters of the [[Vistula]] River close to [[Włocławek]].

The notice of the murder caused disorders in Poland, and the authors of the murder - the captains [[Grzegorz Piotrowski]], Leszek Pękala, Waldemar Chmielewski and the colonel Adam Petruszka - were judged guilty and stated punishment to 25 years of prison, but were freed as consequence of [[amnesty]] some year later.

To the funeral, taking place the [[November 3|3rd of November]], took part more than 400.000 persons, including the leader of Solidarność [[Lech Wałęsa]].

== Beatification ==
His grave is aim of regular [[pilgrimage]]s, from the Poland and from another countries; the [[June 14|14th of July]] [[1987]] prayed on his grave also [[pope John Paul II]].

The Catholic Church began the process of [[beatification]] in the [[1997]].

The [[December 19|19th of December]] [[2009]], [[Pope Benedict XVI]] gave formal permission for the [[Congregation for the Causes of Saints]] to issue the decree regarding ""the [[martyrdom]] of Servant of God, George Popiełuszko, [[diocese|diocesan]] priest; born the 14th of September 1947 in Okopy Suchowola (Poland) and killed in hate to the faith the 20th of October 1984 in the near of Włocławek (Poland)"".<ref>{{it}}[http://212.77.1.245/news_services/bulletin/news/24860.php?index=24860&lang=it.foo Promulgation of Decrees of the Congregation of the Causes of Saints, 19/12/2009]</ref>

The solemn mass of beatification of don Jerzy Popiełuszko has been celebrated in [[Warsaw]] Sunday [[June 6|6th of June]] [[2010]], in the square that has a title of the [[Józef Piłsudski|marshal Piłsudski]].

'''''The Missing Link''''' ({{lang-fr|'''Le Chaînon manquant'''}}) is a 1980 French&ndash;Belgian adult animated movie. It was written and directed by [[Picha]]. Though it was not as successful as Picha's [[Tarzoon, la honte de la jungle|previous movie]], it was entered into the [[1980 Cannes Film Festival]].<ref name=""festival-cannes.com"">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/1841/year/1980.html |title=Festival de Cannes: The Missing Link |accessdate=2009-05-28|work=festival-cannes.com}}</ref>

Picha was encouraged to address another subject, that of [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] and his theory of [[evolution]]. Production lasted from 1965 to 1979. In 1974, Picha left for ''[[Tarzoon:Shame of the Jungle]]''. In 1977, 2 years after Tarzoon's release, Picha returned to the project and selected [[Columbia Pictures]] as the movie's distributor. In 1980, the movie was completed and released.

'''Euro''' is the [[currency]] (money) of the [[country|countries]] in the [[eurozone]]. One euro is divided into 100 ''cent'' (officially)<ref>[http://www.ecb.europa.eu/euro/coins/html/index.en.html European Central Bank website terminology]</ref> (singular) or ""cents"" (unofficially).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ecb.int/pub/pdf/conrep/cr200705en.pdf|title=European Central Bank, Covergence report May 2007|format=PDF|quote=The euro is the single currency of the ''Member States'' that have adopted it. To make this singleness apparent, Community law requires a single spelling of the word ''euro'' in the nominative singular case in all Community and national legislative provisions, taking into account the existence of different alphabets.|accessdate=2008-12-29}}</ref>

Because of the number of different languages in the European Union, there are different, unofficial, names for this unit (the French call them ""centimes"" and the Spanish ""céntimos"", for example).

It was created in 1999, but until 1 January 2002 it was used only for electronic payments. In 2002, 12 countries of the [[European Union]] (EU) got rid of their national currencies completely and adopted euro notes and coins as their only money. There was a change-over period, called the ''""transition period""'', when both the old national money and the euro were accepted, but by 28 February 2002, all 12 countries were using just euros.

In 2007, [[Slovenia]] became the 13th country to use the euro<!-- , with a transition period until January 14 -->. In 2008 [[Cyprus]] and [[Malta]] became the 14th and 15th countries to use the euro. In 2009, [[Slovakia]] became the 16th country to use the euro. In 2011, [[Estonia]] became the 17th country to use the euro. In 2014, [[Latvia]] became the 18th country and in 2015, [[Lithuania]] became the 19th country to use the euro.

There are seven different banknotes, each one with a different colour, size and face value: €5 (grey), €10 (red), €20 (blue), €50 (orange), €100 (green), €200 (yellow), €500 (purple).

[[Coin]]s are of eight different amounts: €0.01, €0.02, €0.05, €0.10, €0.20, €0.50, €1, €2.

On every banknote, there is a picture of a different European building style. All banknotes are the same throughout the entire eurozone; there are no different designs for different countries, unlike the euro coins. One side of each coin is the same in all euro countries. The other side is different since each country who mints the coins inserts a symbol relating to that country. Today there are many different sets of coins. Any of the coins can be used everywhere throughout the eurozone despite the country-specific symbol on the back.

The [[European Union#Members since 2004|ten new European countries]] that entered the [[European Union]] in May 2004 are planning to adopt the Euro also. First they must meet some conditions to show that they have stable economies.

== Symbol ==
[[File:Euro symbol.svg|thumb|180px|Official Euro symbol with the official colors]]
The symbol for the euro is the Greek letter [[epsilon]] (E) with two horizontal lines: '''€'''.
[[Image:Euro accession Eurozone as single entity.svg|thumb|right|{{{width|450}}}px|2015:
{{legend|#0080C0|[[European Union|EU]] euro countries (19) }}
{{legend|#66BB66|EU states obliged to join the Eurozone (7) }}
{{legend|#B24400|EU states with an opt-out on Eurozone participation (2) }}
{{legend|yellow|States outside the EU with issuing rights (4)}}
{{legend|purple|Other non-EU users of euro (2)}} ]]

Some people see it as the [[Latin]] capital letter C with an equal sign (=).

It is also legal to simply write ''euro''. This is especially useful when the symbol cannot be produced, or the result is not satisfactory.

Members of the eurozone are:
# [[Austria]]
# [[Belgium]]
# [[Cyprus]]
# [[Estonia]]
# [[Finland]]
# [[France]]
# [[Germany]]
# [[Greece]]
# [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]
# [[Italy]]
# [[Latvia]]
# [[Lithuania]]
# [[Luxembourg]]
# [[Malta]]
# [[The Netherlands]]
# [[Portugal]]
# [[Slovakia]]
# [[Slovenia]]
# [[Spain]]
These countries form the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU).

Even though they are not part of the EU, the euro is also the currency used in:
# [[Andorra]] 1)
# [[Monaco]] 1)
# [[San Marino]] 1)
# [[Vatican City]] 1)
# [[Kosovo]] 2)
# [[Montenegro]] 2)
* 1) this countries print own mints
* 2) this countries use the euro unofficial
<br />
Many other countries' currencies are ""[[currency|pegged]]"" (tied) to, although not exactly equal to, the euro:
* [[Cape Verde]]an escudo
* [[Comoros]] franc
* Central African CFA franc
* West African CFA franc
* France's Pacific territories [[CFP Franc]]
* [[Bosnia-Herzegovina]]n convertible mark
* [[Morocco]] dirham
* [[Bulgaria]]n lev
* [[Hungary]] forint
* [[Denmark]] krone

'''Secularism''', also called '''Secularity''' or  is the idea of something being not religious or not connected to a church. An example of this is the government, which is independent of any religion in many states. In some countries, such as [[Pakistan]], [[Iran]] or [[Saudi Arabia]], there is a [[state religion]]. In that case, the government follows the state religion. In contrast, [[India]] and [[United States]] had [[Founding Fathers of the United States|founding fathers]] who  made a [[law]] that religion and government should stay separate. This means that anyone can choose to practice or [[atheism|not practice]] any religion they want, and the government cannot make them be a part of a religion if they do not want to.

In a theocracy the priests of religion are the rulers of the country."
