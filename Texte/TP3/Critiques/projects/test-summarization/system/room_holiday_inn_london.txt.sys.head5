We arrived at 23,30 hours and they could not recommend a restaurant so we decided to go to Tesco, with very limited choices but when you are hingry you do not careNext day they rang the bell at 8,00 hours to clean the room, not being very nice being waken up so earlyEvery day they gave us a candy bar and two bottlets of water whic is a very nice touch .
 We had a room with two double beds which was surprisingly roomy, considering the small hotel rooms I have in previous trips to London .
The room was quiet, clean, the bed and pillows were comfortable, and the service was adequate .
 We arrived about 11 am, room was ready .
 Room was good size for Europe ,  clean throughout .
