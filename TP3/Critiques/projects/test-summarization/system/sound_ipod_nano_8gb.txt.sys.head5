 headphone jack i got a clear case for it and it  i got a clear case for it and it like prvents me from being able to put the jack all the way in so the sound can b messsed up or i can get it in there and its playing well them go to move or something and it slides out .
 Picture and sound quality are excellent for this typ of devic .
 Great sound, easy to load & use once I read the instructions .
 The music I loaded sounds clear and crisp .
 As for the overall sound I would give it a 8 out of 10, and the volume offers itself loud enough to tune out everything else at your local gym .
