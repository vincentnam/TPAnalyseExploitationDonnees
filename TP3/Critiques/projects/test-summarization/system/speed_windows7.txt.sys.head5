Windows 7 is quite simply faster, more stable, boots faster, goes to sleep faster, comes back from sleep faster, manages your files better and on top of that it's beautiful to look at and easy to use .
, faster about 20% to 30% faster at running applications than my Vista ,  seriously
 Yes, it'll make your computer run a bit slower but
,  Fast startup and performance
 Also, in my non, benchmarked experience, Windows 7 has been at least as fast as XP if not faster .
